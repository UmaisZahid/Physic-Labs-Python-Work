    "## Drawing the bird\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to use vPython's 2d path/curve objects for drawing the bird as I preferred its appearance over vpython's built in 3d objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This created a  number of issues due to vPython's lack of support for moving or even manipulating curves/paths. As a consequence, I had to define functions to compute and redraw the curves of the bird's frame as the program ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, I had to manually compute the rotation of the wing paths to ensure they were horizontal. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The updatePosition draw function\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is provided a new position vector as input. It subsequently recomputes the path lists that define the bird's curves and redraws these curves to the scene. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the wings it calls the updateWing function on all elements of the birdWing path list. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The updateWing function\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the bird's wings are flapping, it is only being influenced by gravity. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function is provided a vector representing a position on the birdWing. This vector is then manipulated with a function that mimics the appearance of a bird wing. I modelled this function on a travelling (x*cosine) wave with a period of 0.5s. The additional 'x' factor ensures that the wave attentuates as it nears the hinge point, creating a realistic wing flap motion "

    "## Simulating free fall, collision and other functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our projectile (bird) was modelled as a 0.5m sphere of mass 0.1kg, experiencing projectile motion under the influence of gravity. \n",
    "\n",
    "If collision occurs it is modelled as being perfectly elastic (momentum is completely transferred). The resultant momentum transfer is modelled as occuring within 0.01 seconds, which impacts a respective force, and a related torque on the target box. \n",
    "\n",
    "This torque was compared in magnitude to the opposing gravitational torque on the box, and if applied torque was large enough, it was considered toppled. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The restartGame function\n",
    "\n",
    "This function ensures that all variables related to the current game state are reset if the user is unsuccessful in toppling the target.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The updateLabel function\n",
    "\n",
    "This function updates all labels, and is called every time that the bird's position changes. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inaccuracies due to impact parameter and bird radius (0.3m vs 0.05m)\n",
    "\n",
    "The bird we were modelling was in actuality a sphere of radius 0.05m, however, in our simulation we used a sphere of radius 0.3m. This was largely for aesthetic or visual purposes. However, due to this fact our impact parameter also had to 0.3m, otherwise our bird would appear to be embedded in the target box. \n",
    "\n",
    "This meant that our values for torque and collision height were in fact off by a small factor, as the 0.3m bird had to travel less time before hitting the box, and therefore it's vertical position was different. Thereby causing a smaller torque, and thus creating a source of inaccuracy in our simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Box toppling\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially the box was programmed to topple accurately with respect to the imparted torque, as well as the constantly changing gravitational torque as it rotated, and thus the changing angular velocity. This was promising at first, however due to difficulties with vpython's rotate function I abandoned this approach for a simple visually appealing, and physically inaccurate animation of the box being thrown away by the bird. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given more time, a more accurate interaction could be modelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues with vpython print statements in jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Intermittently, print statements refuse to output to the jupyter notebook. This occurs more than half of the time when running the code above and appears to be a fault of vpython and jupyter. This consequently results in no output of the collision height, momentum transferred and the torques. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Score counter\n",
    "\n",
    "The score counter is largely useless except for negative values, as the game does not restart if you win. And therefore only losses are counted. However, this can be remedied easily by providing a prompt asking to restart the game even after victory. "
